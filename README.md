Features
--------
Your visitor simply selects the person they wish to see, and that person is e-mailed (and text messaged if desired) to let them know that they have a visitor, along with a photo of the visitor. An electronic Visitor Log keeps tracks of all visitor registrations. You can even have visitor photo badges printed!

**E-Mail and Text Alerts**
When an employee is selected from the Sign In screen, that employee receives an e-mail (and text message) alerting them to their visitor. A photo of the visitor is attached to the e-mail for security purposes. Works with any e-mail account (Yahoo Mail, Gmail, Hotmail, Exchange, etc).

**Employee Directory**
Employees can easily be entered into the employee directory to receive visitor alerts. The Employee Directory can even be imported from a CSV file to save time.

**Fully Customizable**
Background colors, text colors, fonts, company logos, and more can be fully customized to match your company look and feel.

**Easy Setup**
You can be up and running in as little as 2 minutes! No technical knowledge required!

**Visitor Log**
All visitor sign-in's and sign-outs are recorded in an electronic visitor log database, along with the visitors photo. Visitor statistics are even available!

Motion and face detection can be enabled to announce a spoken greeting to your visitors and invite them to sign in.
